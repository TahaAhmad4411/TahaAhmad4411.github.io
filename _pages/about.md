AI & Computational Scientist

I am a Computational Science and Engineering graduate researcher with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, and data-driven systems. Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s in Computational Science and Engineering at NUST Islamabad, where I also work as a Research Assistant on applied AI projects.

My work spans deep learning, LLM-based systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with hands-on experience in designing end-to-end pipelines that integrate vector databases, external APIs, and modern foundation models. I have contributed to AgriTech-focused AI solutions, applying machine learning and natural language processing to real-world problems.

Previously, I worked at Afiniti, where I gained industry experience in Python development, data analytics, and system deployment, including client-side deployments during off-production hours. I have also participated in competitive machine learning challenges such as BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation), strengthening my expertise in medical imaging and convolutional neural networks.

This website serves as a central place to document my research, projects, teaching activities, and technical writing. It is built using the Academic Pages template and hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing for transparent version control and reproducible academic-style content.
